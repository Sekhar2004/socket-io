# Socket.io 

This project is a simple(basiccccc) real-time chat application that I developed as part of my learning journey with **Socket.io**. The primary goal of this project was to understand how **Socket.io** works, how real-time communication is established between users, and how to handle messaging in chat rooms.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using JWT-based authentication.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Instant message delivery within chat rooms.
- **Room-Based Chat**: Join, create, or interact in multiple chat rooms.
- **Message History**: Access previous messages when joining a room.
- **User Presence**: Track the number of active users in each room.
- **Message Styling**: Messages from the sender appear on the right, while the receiverâ€™s messages appear on the left.
- **Persistent Storage**: All chat messages are stored in MongoDB for later access.

## Technologies

- **Socket.io**: Enables real-time communication between clients and the server.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for message storage.
- **JWT**: Handles user authentication securely.
