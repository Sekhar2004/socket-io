# Socket.io Chat Application

This project is a simple real-time chat application that I developed as part of my learning journey with **Socket.io**. The primary goal of this project was to understand how **Socket.io** works, how real-time communication is established between users, and how to handle messaging in chat rooms.

## Project Description

In this project, I built a chat application where users can:

- Join specific chat rooms.
- Send and receive messages in real time.
- See the number of users online in the same chat room.
- Have messages styled similarly to common social media chat apps, where:
  - **Sender's messages** appear on the right side of the chat window.
  - **Receiver's messages** appear on the left side.
